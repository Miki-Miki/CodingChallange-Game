# CodingChallange-Game

This repository contains the source code and all the assets used in creating the game "Parallel" (which demo build can be found in its own repository on my profile).

This game was created by my friend Velid (Weh1d) and I. We presented it on the annual FIT Coding Challenge (a big scale competition done at our college which categories, besides Game Development include: Programming Challenge, Innovation Challenge and Cyber Olympics).
